# Write endpoints

This is just a quickstart help, refer to the [Django Ninja documentation](https://django-ninja.rest-framework.com/) for
more details

First you must first define the data types that will get in and out by creating schemas

## Schema

In a `schema.py` file in your app:

```python
from ninja import Schema

class MyInputDataContract(Schema):
    username: str | None
    email: str | None

class MyResponseContract(Schema):
    foo: str | None
    bar: int | None
```

Note the union type `| None`: this is required to let empty
data come in to let Django validate the forms and deliver nice
error messages. Empty data must pass the schema validation if
using Django forms

## Form

Create a Django form. Example with a `ModelForm`, in a `forms.py` file in your app:

```python
from django import forms
from myapp.models import MyModel

class MyForm(forms.ModelForm):

    class Meta:
        model = MyModel
        exclude = (
            "a_field",
        )
```

## Endpoint

We now are going to declare the endpoint with it's schemas and status codes

### Declare the endpoint

In an `api.py` file in your app:

```python
from typing import Tuple
from django.http import HttpRequest
from apps.base.schemas import FormInvalidResponseContract
from .schemas import MyInputDataContract, MyResponseContract

@router.post(
    "/myurl",
    response={
        200: MyResponseContract,
        422: FormInvalidResponseContract,
    },
)
def my_endpoint(
    request: HttpRequest, data: MyInputDataContract
) -> Tuple[int, None | FormInvalidResponseContract | MyResponseContract]:
    pass
```

### Validation and errors

#### 1. Pass the schema

If the data payload sent by the frontend does not comply to the `MyInputDataContract` it
will return a <kbd>418</kbd> http status code, indicating that the developper must fix
the payload to pass the schema

#### 2. Validate the form

The second validation level is the Django form. If the form does not validate and
has error messages for the user we send a <kbd>422</kbd> http status code, indicating
that this is a form validation error:

```python
form = MyForm(data=data.dict())
if not form.is_valid():
    return 422, {"errors": form.errors.get_json_data(escape_html=True)}
form.save()
```

And return a valid <kbd>200</kbd> http status code with the data out payload
that validates the `MyResponseContract` schema:

```python
return 200, {
  "foo": "lorem ipsum",
  "bar": 42
}
```
